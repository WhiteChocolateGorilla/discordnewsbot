# discordnewsbot



This bot uses the request library to retrieve the top news headlines from the News API (https://newsapi.org/). 
It then constructs a message with the top 5 headlines and sends it to the specified Discord channel.

To use this bot, you will need to replace YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY with your own News API key and YOUR_CHANNEL_ID with the ID of the Discord channel where you want the news updates to be posted.
You will also need to replace YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN with your own Discord bot token.

You can use the !news command to manually trigger the news updates, or you can set a timer to automatically post updates every 24 hours.
